Fully mobile responsive (from phone to desktop size)
 
No pre-made templates allowed for this one. Build from scratch.  
 
 
Tweeter additions (required):
Complete list of personalized feedback items that you received after part 1.
 
GIF Comments
Your Vue Giphy Search module must be integrated in to Tweeter
Users should be able to make comments that use GIF images instead of text.
 
AJAX Like button
Use AJAX to update the like count in the database
Update the displayed like count without a refresh
Be able to "unlike" as well
There should be a visual indication that you have liked a post.  
 
Paginate Tweets (on feed and anywhere else they are displayed)
See: https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/pagination
 (Links to an external site.)

Note! If you choose to infinite scrolling, then traditional pagination is not required, and you will receive an additional 5% bonus.    
 
Bonus Tweeter ideas (5% each unless otherwise indicated):
Nested comments
User can reply directly to another users comment
You only need to go "1 level deep".  Like Facebook comments!
 
Share URL's (with preview)
Example: url-preview-example.PNG
 
Login with Socialite (10%)


See: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/
 (Links to an external site.)

Show a "profile card" when hovering a username
Utilize AJAX to pull profile information from the database
Display that information (name, profile, etc...)
See Facebook & Twitter for examples of this
 
Search (10%, 5% for each)
Search by username and/or email
Search by hashtags (only if implementing hashtags too)
 
Infinite scroll


Use AJAX to continuously load Tweets when the user scrolls down
Example: www.facebook.com
 (Links to an external site.)
Links to an external site.
 
 
Re-tweeting
If you re-tweet something, you must give attribution to the author
Link back to the original tweet
 
Notification system (10%)
Someone likes your tweet
Someone follows you
Someone comments on your Tweet
Someone replies to your comment
 
Hashtagging (10%)
What's trending
Hashtags in Tweets must be clickable, and show a list of related Tweets
 
Private messaging (10%)
One to one private messages
Maintain an "inbox" of messages
 
Tweet using an uploaded photo (5%)
 
Comment using an uploaded photo (5%)
We could easily refactor our GIF comments a little bit to implement this!
